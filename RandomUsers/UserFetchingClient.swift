    /// Swift provides a URLSession.shared.data(from: URL) function to request data from a specified URL. The function returns two value types: Data and URLResponse. The URLResponse will contain associated metadata, and the Data will contain any data in the response. In this project, you will only use the Data value.
    /// Since the function returns two values, define a tuple (data, _) to store the data. The second property is an _ because you donâ€™t need to use the URLResponse here.
    /// By default, URLSession operations occur on a background thread
    ///
    /// The getUsers() function is declared as a throwing, asynchronous function because it executes asynchronous operations and may have errors in those operations.
    /// The call to get random user data is made asynchronously using the async keyword, then accessed using the await keyword to ensure that data is present before continuing.
